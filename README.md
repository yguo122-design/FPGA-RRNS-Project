it's a project of ELE324 individual project ( University of Sheiffield).

purpose:
• Algorithm Validation: Quantitatively evaluate the error correction capability and performance 
advantages of 3NRM-RRNS and 2NRM-RRNS codes through MATLAB simulation, with specific 
focus on cluster fault tolerance capability compared to C-RRNS and RS codes 
• Hardware Implementation: Design and implement efficient encoder/decoder architectures for all 
four coding schemes (RS, C-RRNS, 3NRM-RRNS, 2NRM-RRNS) using hardware description 
languages 
• Performance Benchmarking: Conduct comprehensive performance analysis including resource 
utilization, timing characteristics, and power consumption on FPGA platforms 
• Practical Validation: Demonstrate the practical feasibility of the proposed RRNS variants for real
world memory protection applications
